        For a large number of tosses the MCMC in the original scale
        experiences overflow errors and thus fails to produce valid samples.
        In the logarithmic scale we observe that increasing the number of
        tosses (while keeping the number of heads and tails equal) reduces
        the variance of the posterior distribution as the prior is more
        certain that the coin is fair.

    If the grass is high at one point it should be of roughly equal height in
    its immediate surroundings for a sufficiently \say{nice} (e.g.\
    continuous) function as we would expect grass growth to be from our
    experience in the real world.
    Thus Mr. Kueheli suggests to move roughly 200 meters along each axis
    (in both directions), as he can only see that far, and check if there
    are any more cows there.
    The suggested locations can be found in
    Listing~\ref{lst:CowsOptGrassCoords} and the corresponding $check\_cows$
    outputs are presented in listings~\ref{lst:CowsOptTopGrassCoords},
    \ref{lst:CowsOptRightGrassCoords},~\ref{lst:CowsOptLeftGrassCoords},

    We found another 16 cows which is roughly to be expected as cows tend to
    be where the grass is high which is roughly around the maximum as
    outlined above.
    Of course, we cannot expect all cows to be concentrated around this
    area as then they would eat all the grass and move on to other places.
    For this reason we assume the cows to be distributed around different
    areas of Mr. Kueheli's farm.


    \subsubsection*{c)}
    \label{subsubsec:Task1c}

    We use Korali's TMCMC sampling engine to gain a better understanding of
    the grass growth at the farm and display the results in
    Figure~\ref{fig:GrassHeight}.

    \begin{figure}[H]
         \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{task1/results/task1c.eps}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Visualization of the grass growth distribution.
        We oberserve maxima at roughly $\left( 4.08, 3 .75 \right)$

        $\left( 3, 2.5 \right)$.}
        \label{fig:GrassHeight}
    \end{figure}

    With this information we check for cows at the maximum
    $\left( 3, 2.5 \right)$ and in its immediate surroundings (as we can see
    that the grass is also fairly high there) and we present the terminal
    outputs in listings~\ref{lst:CowsOpt},~\ref{lst:CowsOptRight},
    and~\ref{lst:CowsOptLeft}.

    \end{lstlisting}

    The initial strategy relied on the fact that enough cows could be found
    around the point of maximum grass height.
    However, the maximum only gives us a point estimate and no information
    about the underlying distribution of the grass growth (and thus no
    information about the grass height in the neighborhood of the global
    maximum).
    Thus by sampling the distribution, we were able to locate lager areas
    of high grass and correspondingly also more cows.
    In this concrete case, we observe that the global maximum has a
    relatively small neighborhood of high grass whereas other local maxima
    have larger areas of high grass surrounding them.
    Naturally, we expect more cows in larger areas of high grass than in a
    small area with very high grass as cows tend to value some personal
    space\footnote{This has been verified via personal communication with a
    large sample of cows.}.
    Of course, we don't know this before looking at the underlying distribution
    so the initial strategy is not the most efficient (of course, this
    assumes the we can actually sample from the distribution).

    \subsubsection*{d)}
    \label{subsubsec:Task1d}

    We can use Korali to investigate the posterior distribution of the
    parameters pH and mm given the grass growth and suitable priors.
    Naturally we model the experts' clues as prior distributions of the pH and
    the rain volume.
    More concretely, we set $p(\text{pH}) \sim \mathcal{U}(4, 9)$ and
    $p(\text{mm}) \sim \mathcal{N}(90, 20)$.
    Korali requires us to set bounds for the Gaussian prior on mm.
    We choose the lower bound of $0$ (as we cannot have negative rain) and
    the upper bound of $180$ (for symmetry around the mean).
    Employing Korali's CMA-ES solver we maximize the posterior and we display
    the results in Listing~\ref{lst:MaxGrassPosterior}.

    \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny, frame=single, caption={Korali
    output when maximizing the posterior of the pH and mm parameters.},
    label={lst:MaxGrassPosterior}]

    \end{lstlisting}

    We observe that both parameter values at the maximum of the posterior lie
    within the optimal range for pumpkins.
    However, the uncertainty --- as quantified by the value of $\sigma$ --- is
    rather high.
    For this, reason we sample from the posterior distribution of the
    parameters with Korali's TMCMC sampling engine to get a better estimate
    of the soil and we display the results in Figure~\ref{fig:GrassPosterior}.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{task1/results/task1d.eps}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Visualization of the posterior distribution of the
        parameters.
        The histogram in the center shows that the pH distribution is skewed
        to the right of $7.5$.
        The bottom-right histogram shows that the rain volume falls almost
        entirely within the range $\left[ 110, 120 \right]$.
        }
        \label{fig:GrassPosterior}
    \end{figure}

    We observe that there is very probably enough rain, i.e.\ more than
    $100mm$ per month.
    However, we also observe that the pH at the maximum of the posterior is
    atypical in the sense that it does not give us a good estimate of the pH
    distribution as it is very likely that the actual soil conditions will
    fall within the range $\left[ 7.5, 9 \right]$.
    Unfortunately, this means that we cannot fully recommend that Ms.
    Kleineblume plant pumpkins at this point of the year as the soil is
    probably to basic for her crop.

    \subsection*{Task 2}
    \label{subsec:Task2}

    \subsubsection*{a)}
    \label{subsubsec:Task2a}

    We use the heat2DSolver to model the temperature distribution on the
    steel sheets.
    Since we want to determine how many candles were used during the
    manufacturing we consider three cases with different parameters (x- and
    y-coordinate for every candle):

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[--] one candle: candle can be applied anywhere on the sheet,
        i.e.\ uniformly between $0$ and $1$ for both axes.
        \item[--] two candles: the first candle is located on the left half,
        the second on the right half so we restrict the upper and lower bounds
        for the x-axis to $[0, 0.5]$ and $[0.5, 1]$ respectively.
        \item[--] three candles: similar to the two-candle case the third
        candle is restricted to $[0.5, 1]$ on the x-axis.
    \end{itemize}

    Since we are comparing three different models we want to compare the
    model evidence to determine the best model.
    For this reason, we employ Korali's TMCMC sampling engine to obtain the
    log-evidence of the likelihood (since we don't have any prior
    information on the candle positions) for all three models which we show in
    listings~\ref{lst:OneCandleEvidence},~\ref{lst:TwoCandleEvidence},
    and~\ref{lst:ThreeCandleEvidence}.

    We observe that the 3-candles model has the highest evidence and thus it
    is most likely that 3 workers treated the sheet.
    To find the most likely positions of every candle we maximize the
    likelihood with Korali's CMA-ES solver and display the output for the
    optimal model (and the two other models for completeness) in
    listings~\ref{lst:OneCandleMax},~\ref{lst:TwoCandleMax},
    and~\ref{lst:ThreeCandleMax}.

    Hence, for our selected model we find the most likely candle positions to
    be:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[--] candle one at $[0.208636, 0.219382]$
        \item[--] candle two at $[0.705800, 0.709230]$
        \item[--] candle three at $[0.804045, 0.802827]$
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection*{b)}
    \label{subsubsec:Task2b}

    We now have prior information on the candle positions that we can
    incorporate into our model.
    Hence, we formulate the following prior distributions for the
    x-coordinates:
    \mbox{$\text{candle-}1_{ x} \sim \mathcal{N}\left( 0.25, 0.05 \right)$}, \
    \mbox{$\text{candle-}2_{ x} \sim \mathcal{N}\left( 0.75, 0.05 \right)$}, and
    \mbox{$\text{candle-}3_{ x} \sim \mathcal{N}\left( 0.75, 0.05 \right)$}.
    We keep the upper and lower bounds from the previous subtask for both
    axes.
    Since we have prior information we now investigate the posterior
    distribution of the parameters with the same solvers as described in the
    previous subtask and we present the results in
    listings~\ref{lst:ThreeCandlePosteriorEvidence}
    and~\ref{lst:ThreeCandlePosteriorMax}.

    \end{lstlisting}

    We observe that the model evidence is higher than before implying that
    incorporating the prior information provides a \say{better fit} with
    respect to the observed data.
    Hence, we conclude that applying the candles at the new optimal
    positions should result in a build quality similar to that of sheet
    $\#004392$.
    The new optimal candle positions are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[--] candle one at $[0.209252, 0.220602]$
        \item[--] candle two\footnote{The numbering of
        candles two and three is arbitrary and thus we swap the numbers to
        keep the optimal positions consistent with the previous subtask.} at
        $[0.708072, 0.707453]$
        \item[--] candle three at $[0.803022, 0.804381]$
    \end{itemize}
